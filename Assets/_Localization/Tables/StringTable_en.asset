      The Yucatecan parrot, also known as the
      "Yucatan parakeet," is a species of parrot endemic to the Yucatan Peninsula
      in Mexico. Although it was previously abundant, its population has significantly
      declined due to deforestation, illegal pet trade, and habitat loss. Conservation
      efforts focus on protecting tropical forests and implementing measures to combat
      the illegal bird trade. Public education also plays a crucial role in raising
